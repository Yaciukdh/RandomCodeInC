Fileserver is an older file that accepts 3 commands, GET, PUT, and LIST

LIST: list all regular files in the directory
PUT: Send file from client to server 
GET: Send file from server to client

There is some additional nuisance that I don't remember.

Chatserver is a more recent file where multiple people can sign into a server with either a UDP or TCP connection.

It has the basic functionality to it, but is missing some more advanced features like broadcast and share, 
which would require a looped send through all logged on users. This was the last assignment but I already had an A is OS
so I submitted it incomplete.
